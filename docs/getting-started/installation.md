# Installation

## Prerequisites

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Windows | Windows 11 24H2 or later (required for NPU support) |
| Hardware | Device with CPU, GPU, or NPU |
| Python | 3.11 |
| Package manager | [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) |
| Version control | `git` |

!!! note "No NPU?"
    You can follow most of these docs without NPU hardware. All winml-cli commands accept `--device auto` and fall back to CPU or DirectML automatically. The tutorials document explicit CPU fallback paths.

## Install

```bash
uv python install 3.11
uv pip install winml-cli
```

`uv python install 3.11` downloads and pins the exact Python version the project requires. `uv pip install winml-cli` installs the latest release from PyPI into a managed environment. No separate venv activation is needed.

!!! warning "Windows on Arm requires x64 Python"
    winml-cli supports **x64 (AMD64) Python only**. On an Arm64 device, native Arm64 Python cannot install the dependencies because PyTorch and the Windows ML runtime packages publish no `win_arm64` wheels — `uv sync` fails with an unsupported-platform error. Install an x64 build of Python 3.11 and point `uv` at it:

    ```powershell
    uv python install cpython-3.11-windows-x86_64-none
    uv sync --extra dev --python cpython-3.11-windows-x86_64-none
    ```

    The x64 interpreter runs under Windows emulation on Arm64 hardware; `winml sys` still reports the Arm64 machine, and the NPU/GPU/CPU providers work normally.

!!! tip "Install from source (for development)"
    If you want to contribute or run the latest unreleased code:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/winml-cli.git
    cd winml-cli
    uv sync
    ```

## Verify

```bash
winml sys
```

Expected output (abbreviated):

Environment
  Python Version    3.11.x
  OS                Windows 11
  Machine           AMD64

ML Libraries
  Library        Version   Status
  torch          2.x.x     OK
  onnx           1.x.x     OK

Available Devices (priority order)
  #1  NPU   ...
  #2  GPU   ...
  #3  CPU   ...

Available Execution Providers
  QNNExecutionProvider           -> NPU
  DmlExecutionProvider           -> GPU
  CPUExecutionProvider           -> CPU
```

This command enumerates available compute devices and execution providers on your machine. If an expected device or execution provider is missing, `winml sys` is the right place to diagnose it. See [winml sys](../commands/sys.md) for the full flag reference and troubleshooting tips.
